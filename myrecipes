chocolate cookies

1) First you have to add 100 gm unsalted/ salted butter. If you have white butter so you can add that 100 gm

2) Then in the butter, add 1/2 tsp Powdered sugar. You can put some sugar in the mixer grinder and your 
Powdered sugar will be ready at 
home or you can buy from stores.

Mix well. The mixture of butter and Powdered sugar should be bit smooth.

3) Add 1 tbsp Whole wheat flour and 1/2 tsp baking powder in the mixture. Mix it.

Now you have to make a dough of the mixture. Use milk to make the dough. 

4) Now once the dough is ready, take some dough on your hands of lemon size and make the shape of cookie.
 If you want your
 cookie to be of bigger size so you can take more dough on your hands. The size of the cookie is upto you.

5) Now take a kadhai and keep it on the gas. In the kadhai keep a stand. Preheat it for 5 mins. 

6) Now, take a cake tin or any tin and grease it with oil. Keep your cookies in the tin and make sure that you keep some 
space between the cookies in the tin to get space to puff out. 

7) After you Preheat the kadhai with stand for 5 mins, keep the tin with cookies on the stand in kadhai. 

8) Bake for 15- 20 mins.

A tip: If you are baking the cookies in cooker, so remove the whistle and. Keep a stand in it, Preheat for 5 mins, and then 
keep the tin of cookies in the cooker and let it cook for 35 mins.

: If you have an oven, so grease the plate of the oven with oil, and then keep cookies on it and keep it in oven.
 In oven, let it bake for 15 mins. 

You can cook in kadhai, cooker or in the oven. I have given how much to bake. But if you think the cookies have not become 
lightly brown even from the sides of the cookies so you can bake if for more 5-10. But if you think it's brown or light brown even from the 
sides of the cookies so it is baked.

9) Remove the cookies out from the kadhai/ cooker/ oven.

10) And let the cookies cool completely.

  ENJOY THE COOKIES!!
